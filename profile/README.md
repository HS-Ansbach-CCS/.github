# Center for Signal Analysis of Complex Systems

Complex systems occur in the most diverse areas of economics, natural sciences and engineering. They are usually characterized by the non-linear interaction of many (microscopic or mesoscopic) components and can exhibit a variety of structures on a macroscopic level. These structures can have a spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal character and can be recorded quantitatively. This can result in large amounts of multivariate data. For many applications, it is important to interpret these datasets using classifications and macroscopic descriptions in order to make predictions and/or better understand the underlying mechanisms.
